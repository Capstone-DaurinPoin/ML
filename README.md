# Machine Learning documentation
# The process :

1. Loading the Dataset
2. Loading Pre-trained Model (MobileNetV2)
3. Tuning the Model
4. Building the Model
5. Training the Model
6. Saving the Model
7. Model Evaluation
8. Converting Model to TFLite

# Using MobileNet V2

We using MobileNetV2 for transfer learning in image classification tasks in this application because has several advantages:

- MobileNetV2 is designed to be lightweight and efficient
- MobileNetV2 utilizes depthwise separable convolution
- MobileNetV2 has demonstrated good performance on mobile and edge device
- MobileNetV2 is pre-trained on large-scale datasets, often with millions of images
- TensorFlow Hub provides a convenient way to access pre-trained models, including MobileNetV2, for transfer learning
